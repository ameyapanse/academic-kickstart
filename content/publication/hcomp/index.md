abstract = "In this paper, we explore the problem of learning a policy from non-expert human demonstrators. We use a consensus algorithm to estimate consensus actions and learn worker skill levels. We iteratively update the skill levels while training an RL agent using learned weights for demonstrations over the entire training period. We perform our experiments in the Atari Learning Environment (ALE) available on OpenAI Gym and show initial results."
